## Description
A hub-module for the public modules and other utilities I've written in the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey).

NOTE: 'Console' is a class I wrote for private purposes, and is not included with this module.

Special thanks to Sergej "sereschkin" Ackermann, as well as the other members of the Monkey community for their [external bindings of the GLFW clipboard functionality](http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=9179).

## Installation
This module is officially distributed with the [Regal Modules](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/regal-modules#regal-modules) project. To install this module, please follow the installation guide provided with that repository.
